      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Distribution installers, cloud instantiation, image builds for particular devices, or any other way to deploy an operating system put its desired network configuration into YAML configuration file(s). During early boot, the netplan "network renderer" runs which reads <code>/{lib,etc,run}/netplan/*.yaml</code> and writes configuration to <code>/run</code> to hand off control of devices to the specified networking daemon.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Configured devices get handled by systemd-networkd by default, unless explicitly marked as managed by a specific renderer (NetworkManager)</li>
        <li>Devices not covered by the network config do not get touched at all.</li>
        <li>Usable in initramfs (few dependencies and fast)</li>
        <li>No persistent generated config, only original YAML config</li>
        <li>Parser supports multiple config files to allow applications like libvirt or lxd to package up expected network config (<code>virbr0</code>, <code>lxdbr0</code>), or to change the global default policy to use NetworkManager for everything.</li>
        <li>Retains the flexibility to change backends/policy later or adjust to removing NetworkManager, as generated configuration is ephemeral.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="general-structure">General structure</h2>
      <p>netplan's configuration files use the <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/current.html">YAML</a> format. All <code>/{lib,etc,run}/netplan/*.yaml</code> are considered. Lexicographically later files (regardless of in which directory they are) amend (new mapping keys) or override (same mapping keys) previous ones. A file in <code>/run/netplan</code> completely shadows a file with same name in <code>/etc/netplan</code>, and a file in either of those directories shadows a file with the same name in <code>/lib/netplan</code>.</p>
      <p>The top-level node in a netplan configuration file is a <code>network:</code> mapping that contains <code>version: 2</code> (the YAML currently being used by curtin, MAAS, etc. is version 1), and then device definitions grouped by their type, such as <code>ethernets:</code>, <code>wifis:</code>, or <code>bridges:</code>. These are the types that our renderer can understand and are supported by our backends.</p>
      <p>Each type block contains device definitions as a map where the keys (called "configuration IDs") are defined as below.</p>

      <h2 id="device-configuration-ids">Device configuration IDs</h2>
      <p>The key names below the per-device-type definition maps (like <code>ethernets:</code>) are called "ID"s. They must be unique throughout the entire set of configuration files. Their primary purpose is to serve as anchor names for composite devices, for example to enumerate the members of a bridge that is currently being defined.</p>
      <p>There are two physically/structurally different classes of device definitions, and the ID field has a different interpretation for each:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Physical devices</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            (Examples: ethernet, wifi) These can dynamically come and go between reboots and even during runtime (hotplugging). In the generic case, they can be selected by <code>match:</code> rules on desired properties, such as name/name pattern, MAC address, driver, or device paths. In general these will match any number of devices (unless they refer to properties which are unique such as the full path or MAC address), so without further knowledge about the hardware these will always be considered as a group.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is valid to specify no match rules at all, in which case the ID field is simply the interface name to be matched. This is mostly useful if you want to keep simple cases simple, and it's how network device configuration has been done for a long time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there are <code>match</code>: rules, then the ID field is a purely opaque name which is only being used for references from definitions of compound devices in the config.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Virtual devices</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              (Examples: veth, bridge, bond) These are fully under the control of the config file(s) and the network stack. I. e. these devices are being created instead of matched. Thus <code>match:</code> and <code>set-name:</code> are not applicable for these, and the ID field is the name of the created virtual device.
            </p>

      <h2 id="common-properties-for-physical-device-types">Common properties for physical device types</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt><code>match</code> (mapping)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            This selects a subset of available physical devices by various hardware properties. The following configuration will then apply to all matching devices, as soon as they appear. <em>All</em> specified properties must match.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>name</code> (scalar)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Current interface name. Globs are supported, and the primary use case for matching on names, as selecting one fixed name can be more easily achieved with having no <code>match:</code> at all and just using the ID (see above). Note that currently only networkd supports globbing, NetworkManager does not.
          </p>
        </dd>
      <dt><code>macaddress</code> (scalar)</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Device's MAC address in the form "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX". Globs are not allowed.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><code>driver</code> (scalar)</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Kernel driver name, corresponding to the <code>DRIVER</code> udev property. Globs are supported. Matching on driver is <em>only</em> supported with networkd.
        </p>
      </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>all cards on second PCI bus:</p>
        <pre><code>match:
          name: enp2*</code></pre></li>
        <li><p>fixed MAC address:</p>
        <pre><code>match:
          macaddress: 11:22:33:AA:BB:FF</code></pre></li>
        <li><p>first card of driver <code>ixgbe</code>:</p>
        <pre><code>match:
          driver: ixgbe
          name: en*s0</code></pre></li>
      </ul>

      <dd>
        <dt><code>set-name</code> (scalar)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            When matching on unique properties such as path or MAC, or with additional assumptions such as "there will only ever be one wifi device", match rules can be written so that they only match one device. Then this property can be used to give that device a more specific/desirable/nicer name than the default from udev’s ifnames. Any additional device that satisfies the match rules will then fail to get renamed and keep the original kernel name (and dmesg will show an error).
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>wakeonlan</code> (bool)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Enable wake on LAN. Off by default.

        <dd>
          <p>
            Use the given networking backend for this definition. Currently supported are <code>networkd</code> and <code>NetworkManager</code>. This property can be specified globally in <code>networks:</code>, for a device type (in e. g. <code>ethernets:</code>) or for a particular device definition. Default is <code>networkd</code>.

          <p>
            Accept Router Advertisement that would have the kernel configure IPv6 by itself. On by default.

        </dd>
        <dt><code>addresses</code> (sequence of scalars)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Add static addresses to the interface in addition to the ones received through DHCP or RA. Each sequence entry is in CIDR notation, i. e. of the form <code>addr/prefixlen</code>. <code>addr</code> is an IPv4 or IPv6 address as recognized by <strong><code>inet_pton</code></strong>(3) and <code>prefixlen</code> the number of bits of the subnet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example: <code>addresses: [192.168.14.2/24, 2001:1::1/64]</code>
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>gateway4</code>, <code>gateway6</code> (scalar)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Set default gateway for IPv4/6, for manual address configuration. This requires setting <code>addresses</code> too. Gateway IPs must be in a form recognized by <strong><code>inet_pton</code></strong>(3).
          </p>
          <p>
            Example for IPv4: <code>gateway4: 172.16.0.1</code><br />
            Example for IPv6: <code>gateway6: 2001:4::1</code>

        <dt><code>nameservers</code> (mapping)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Set DNS servers and search domains, for manual address configuration. There are two supported fields: <code>addresses:</code> is a list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses similar to <code>gateway*</code>, and <code>search:</code> is a list of search domains.
          </p>
